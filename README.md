This is a platformer game made to practice and learn Pygame

Changes made to original design:
- Modified grenade physics to allow them to roll slightly on collision with the floor
- Changed text color for Ammo and Grenades at or beneath a certain amount
- Altered side scrolling threshold when moving right across the level (increases visibility)
- Added a jumping cooldown to make it feel more natural
- Reassigned some keybinds:
  - Jumping is bound to 'Space Bar'
  - Throwing grenades is bound to 'E'
  - Shooting is bound to 'Mouse1'
